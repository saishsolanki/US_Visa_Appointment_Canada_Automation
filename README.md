### Method 2: Manual Configuration
Copy `config.ini.template` to `config.ini` and edit with your details:

```bash
cp config.ini.template config.ini
```

Then edit `config.ini` with your information:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
EMAIL = your_ais_email@example.com
PASSWORD = your_ais_password
CURRENT_APPOINTMENT_DATE = 2025-12-01
LOCATION = Ottawa - U.S. Embassy
START_DATE = 2025-09-25
END_DATE = 2025-12-31
CHECK_FREQUENCY_MINUTES = 5
SMTP_SERVER = smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT = 587
SMTP_USER = your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS = your_gmail_app_password
NOTIFY_EMAIL = your_email@gmail.com
AUTO_BOOK = False

# Performance Optimization Settings
driver_restart_checks = 50
max_retry_attempts = 2
sleep_jitter_seconds = 60
```

### Gmail SMTP Setup
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Generate an "App Password" for this application
3. Use your Gmail address as `SMTP_USER`
4. Use the generated app password as `SMTP_PASS`

**Important**: Replace all placeholder values (starting with "your_") with your actual information before running the script.

For detailed Gmail setup instructions, see [`GMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](GMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

### Performance Configuration
The system includes advanced performance optimizations. For detailed configuration:
- See [`PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`](PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md) for comprehensive performance tuning
